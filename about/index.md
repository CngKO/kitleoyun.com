		<div class='culture-text'>
			At KitleOyun, we have a very simple vision for achieving great results - we think<br>
			the output should come on top of the hours you put in. This vision is<br>
			what initially motivated us and what fuels us every day. We are<br>
			always hungry for knowledge and ready to take up new challenges<br>
			believing that the end result will always be higher quality games. A<br>
			sense of personal responsibility and commitment to our mission are<br>
			the driving force while we strive to bring joy to those who play our games.<br>
			We love what we do and hope that everyone else loves it too!
